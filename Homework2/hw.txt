			CS 32 Homework 2Question 2The first 12 popped coordinates were:(4,6),(3,6), (5,6),(5,7),(5,8), (6,8),(7,8),(8,8),(8,7),(6,6),(4,5), (4,4)Question 4(4,6),(4,5), (5,6), (3,6), (4,4), (6,6), (5,7), (4,3), (5,4), (5,8), (4,2), (6,4),(6,8)These algorithms differ because stacks are LIFO (Last In First Out) and queues are FIFO (First In First Out). This implies that the stack algorithm will check the last element entered first, which is the West element. But in the queue algorithm, the first element will be checked first which is the North element.
